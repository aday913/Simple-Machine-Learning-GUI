# Simple-Machine-Learning-GUI
## Original author: Alexander Day

### Overall goal:
Graphical User Interface (GUI) that can be used to quickly apply common machine learning algorithms to user-provided datasets in order to develop a model for future predictions or just to determine whether such a model is feasible.

**Todo's**:
- [x] Develop initial GUI system that reads in data as a pandas dataframe
- [ ] Incorporate ML algorithms that train on the given dataset
- [ ] Add additional ML features such as K-fold CV and confusion matrix creation
- [ ] Ensure proper libraries are installed when user attempts to run the GUI
